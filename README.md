# Setup ENV engage with LAB-00

The lab_0 will walk you through step by step, through the process of accepting, completing, and submission of assignments in this class.

You will learn about:

- Accepting assignments from Github Classroom.
- Cloning projects from Github.
- Building and running C++ programs from the command-line.
- Getting up and running with a brand new project.
- Completing a project and pushing the results to Github for grading.

This is probably the most important project of this semester and a lot of time and effort has gone into assuming that you have a quick and gentle learning curve and have an easy time completing your projects.

Please go through this lab/tutorial patiently and carefully, paying attention to the _why and what_ as well as the how.

Have fun and have an amazing semester!
